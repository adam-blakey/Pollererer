<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Pollererer Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://gitlab.com/adam.blakey/Pollererer/)

This project was created for three main reasons:

1. To help me keep track of rehearsal absences for a local music group.
2. An excuse to use Tabler.io's amazing admin interface.
3. An opportunity to learn about the ingredients of a modern web application.

### Built With

These are the main pieces of software that this project uses.

* [Tabler](https://tabler.io)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

<!-- DOCUMENTATION -->
## Documentation

Ha! I wish there was documentation. This project is still in its infancy, and is for a very specific use case. If you think you'd benefit from this project, then feel free to get in touch.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local instance of Pollererer running, you'll need to follow the following steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install

* apache2
* php
* mysql (or equivalent)

```sh
apt install apache2 php mysql
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo to your web server root.
2. Setup database; we suggest a username and database name of 'pollererer'.
3. Copy the sample config from test/sample_config.php to config.php
```sh
cp test/sample_config.php config.php
```
4. Appropriately edit the config.php file to match your environment, for example:
```PHP
<?php

$config = array(
	"base_url"        => "https://attendance.pollererer.com/",
	"home_url"        => "https://pollererer.com",
	"db_host"         => "localhost",
	"db_username"     => "mysql_user",
	"db_password"     => "strong_password123456789",
	"db_name"         => "mysql_database",
	"repeat_headings" => true,
	"software_name"   => "Pollererer Attendance",
	"smtp_host"       => "smtp.pollererer.com",
	"smtp_username"   => "attendance@pollererer.com",
	"smtp_password"   => "another_password123456789",
	"smtp_port"       => 465,
	"email_from"      => "attendance@pollererer.com",
	"email_pdf"       => array(1, 3),
	"admin_email"     => "admin@pollererer.com",
	"logo_url"        => "https://pollererer.com/uploads/logo.png",
	"group_name"      => "The Musical Pollererers"
);

?>
```
